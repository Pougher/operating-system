Other stuff:
    - kernel lives at 0xC0100000
    - gdt allocates kernel space from 0xC00FFFFF (0xC0FF offset) to
      0xCFFFFFFF

What I want to do:
    - Allocate pages at address 0xD0000000 for memory management (malloc, calloc, etc.) using virtual
    adddressing
    - Allocate pages from 0xB0000000 - 0xC0000000 for applications
