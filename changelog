Changelog Commit 2

* Added filesystem building script (scripts/buildfilesystem.py)
* Began work on kernel filesystem (KERNFS)
* Barely added rudimentary process loading (its horrible)
* Added check to physical memory manager to signal if a given allocation will
  even fit in memory
* Began work on ELF format reader
* Began work on minimum requirements check
* Updated documentation stack section

Todo:
* Add error reporting (eg. ELF file read fails, error code 27 is put in err),
  this could then be checked with something like geterr() and seterr(), and
  would also reduce the amount of kernel panics, giving more control to the
  programmer
* Add filesystem
* Upgrade keyboard driver
